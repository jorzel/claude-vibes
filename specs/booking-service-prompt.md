Implement the Booking Service according to specs/booking-service-spec.md

Follow these standards:
- See .claude/CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md for general guidelines
- See .claude/STYLE_GUIDE.md for Go conventions
- See .claude/TESTING_SPEC.md for test requirements
- See .claude/OBSERVABILITY.md for observability implementation

Start with:
0. Create openapi.yaml defining the API endpoints
1. Event service with CRUD operations
2. Booking service with ticket booking logic
3. Grafana dashboards for monitoring (generated using makefile)
